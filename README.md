Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the application in development mode.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access the Application

After the development server starts, open your browser and navigate to:

## About the Application

The application includes a **Dashboard page**, which fulfills the base requirements. However, several additional features have been implemented to enhance the **dashboard experience** and provide a more dynamic, interactive interface. These features were not part of the original scope but were added to improve the overall look and feel of the dashboard.

One notable addition is the **data grid component**, where additional information from a dataset is displayed. Users can access this information by clicking the "View Hidden Columns" button, which reveals non-realistic data meant for demonstration purposes.

Below is a list of the **Additional Features** that were incorporated to enrich the dashboard experience.

- **Dashboard Metrics**
- **Wildcard Search Filter**
- **Add New Button** (Clicking it displays a Feedback toast)
- **Export Button** (Clicking it displays a Feedback toast)
- **Interactive and Rich Grid Component** from (AG-GRID)
  - Ag Grid table includes:
    - Column Sorting
    - Column Resizing
    - Column Filter
    - Checkbox Row Selection
    - Pagination

## Task Breakdown

Below is a breakdown of the tasks outlined in the instructions document.

- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **1. API Integration:**

  - APIs Created/Implemented (route: /api/companies)
    - **_GET_**: Returns all company records from `MOCK_DATA.json` file
    - **_DELETE_**: Removes all selected (Ids) from the `MOCK_DATA.json` file

- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **2. Display Company List:**

  - Implemented _AG-Grid_ for the data table component. Upon initial render, only the Checkbox and Company Name columns are visible. To reveal additional hidden columns, click the `View Hidden Columns` button. You can toggle the visibility of these columns by clicking the button repeatedly to show or hide them.

- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **3. Pagination/Infinite Scroll:**

  - Utilized Ag-Grid's out-of-the-box pagination feature in the data table component.

- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **4. Delete Data Request Button:**

  - Delete button with API call, validation and feedback message (toast).

- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **5. State Management:**

  - State management is applied everywhere in the application.

Additional Requirements

- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **1. Use of Typescript**
- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **2. Performance Optimization**
  - **_Loader_** Component used to indicate a loading state for the Datatable component.
  - **_Skeleton_** Component used to indicate a loading state for the mutable texts.
  - **_Memoization_** Use of `useMemo` and `useCallback` react hooks to memoized callback functions for more optimized user experience (Prevents unncessary heavy calculations on each rendering)
- <span style="color: orange;">üòê</span> **2. Responsive Design**
  - **Average**
  - Basic responsiveness has been implemented, though it could be further refined for a better user experience.

Bonus Points

- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **1. Handle error states (e.g., what happens if the API fails to load data)** .

  - Errors handled through the reusable `Toast` component with respective error message and color.
  - Try to tweak the api call and attempt to make a failed api call. Error message should appear.

- <span style="color: green;">‚úÖ</span> **2. Add a loading indicator while fetching the data** .

  - **_Loader_** Component used to indicate a loading state for the Datatable component.
  - **_Skeleton_** Component used to indicate a loading state for the mutable texts.

- <span style="color: green;">‚ùå</span> **3. Implement tests (unit tests or integration tests) using Jest or React Testing Library.**
